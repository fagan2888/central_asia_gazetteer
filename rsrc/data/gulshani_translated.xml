    <loc_sec id="47">Qarakol Province
        <ts>The second province (wilāyat ū ḥukūmat) of the provinces of Bukhara is the district
            (qaẓā) of Qarakol. Its distance from Bukhara the Noble is seven farsakhs. This province
            is vast and populous. The denizens of this province are all well-off, and all of them
            have livestock [lit. "have herds"]. In the past, this province was even vaster; [but
            then] in the span of a century, sand enveloped a quarter of the province from the west,
            north, and south. Nevertheless, [Qarakol is among] the most propserous of the provinces.
            Due to a lack of learning (ʿadam-i ʿilm), the population does not engage in trade.
            However, in this province there are many individuals who own more than one or two
            million Tanga [a currency], and many of them are even wealthier than the Bukharan
            merchants. Qarakol [sheep] skins are well known for their high value, and are even more
            prized in Europe (Ūrūpā ū Farangistān) than in Bukhara, and are obtainable in greater
            numbers and earlier [in the season] than in other provinces. </ts>
        <ts>In this province there is: one brick and morar (lit. "stone," sangīn) madrasa and one
            qārī-khāna (Qur'an reading center); adjacent to the fortress (Qurghan) are seven sufi
            lodges (khānaqāh) (both wooden and stone) and eighteen mosques. [The province] comprises
            809 villages, which contain 150,000 residents. </ts>
        <ts>Water in this province is inadequate, but despite that, agriculture is good. In a bad
            [drought] year, the land is irrigated, which leads to a strong harvest. </ts>
        <ts>To the west of this province is a salt mine, located four farsakhs from the center (az
            markaz-i qażā-yi ān). Every year around ten thousand individuals beset by illnesses of
            the nerves (amrāż-i ʿaṣabānī), such as [check specific terms] come to this salt mine for
            treatment. Even foreigners consider the mineral water from this mine to be superior to
            others. </ts>
        <ts>To the east of this province, in the territory of Paykand, there is a ruin in the sand.
            This is in fact the original, ancient city of Bukhara, and Abdallah bin Ziyad [an Arab
            general during the 8th (?) century] fought there. Now all of the walls and fortresses
            [suwar ū qalʿa ū arg] and some of the buildings still remain, but - in the words of the
            holy Qur'an - <flag>???</flag>. The people of Paykand excavate this area to find silver and gold
            coins, and other old artifacts, and in this manner make their living. The reason for the
            ruination of this province is twofold: first, the Arab armies devastated it during the
            conquest [of the 7th and 8th centuries]; second, sand has enveloped it. For these two
            reasons, the province has fallen into ruin. </ts>
