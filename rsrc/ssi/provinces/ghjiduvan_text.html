   <h3>geography</h3>
   <span>The third province is the 
                district
                qażā
             of Kharqānrūd. This province of Ghijduvan is an ancient city and great
            land.</span>
   <h3>geography</h3>
   <span>This province is long; it spans from the 
                plain
                qir (Turkic origin)
             of Bābā Dūghī to the 
                hill
                tall
             of Ghandak. East-West it is nine farsakhs of pasture and farmland.</span>
   <h3>infrastructure</h3>
   <span>Inside the 
                fortress
                Qurghan
             there are a number of ancient structures, including a stone bathhouse, as
            well as a stone 
                sufi lodge
                khānaqāh
             at the head of the 
                shrine
                mazār
             of Shaykh Tāj al-Dīn. Inside the city there are seven other mosques. Also
            inside that city are one thousand households. The cities of Pirmast and Sultanabad run
            right up against the fortress,
            along which flows a ditch [of water].
             At the head of the 
                Abd al-Khaliq shrine
                Shaykh Abd al-Khaliq Ghijduwani's shrine is the first stop of
                    the "seven saints" pilgrimage circuit.
             at the outskirts of the city there is a 
                stone madrasa built by Ulugh Beg
                This madrasa built by the famous Timurid prince still
                    stands.
            .</span>
   <h3>ethnographic</h3>
   <span>Most of the people are Kazakhs of Nur-Ata who come to this province to work; they do not
            go to Bukhara itself. </span>
   <h3>lore</h3>
   <span>The people of this province are constantly injured by 
                fireworks
                bi-ātash-bāzī ū mūshak-andāzī
             during the holidays . Every year several individuals are killed or injured.
            Nevertheless, they persist in this activity;
            despite their learnedness [in this city], they devote great foolishness to this
                pursuit.
        </span>
   <h3>infrastructure</h3>
   <span>Across five hundred and sixty villages there are 715 mosques and twenty-six
            congregational mosques. </span>
   <h3>sacred</h3>
   <span>In the village of Bāy-Khātūn, at the fut of a great mulberry tree on the road to
            Bukhara, there is a 
                footprint shrine
                qadam-gāh
             of Bahā’ al-Dīn [Naqshband] from when he was on 
                pilgrimage
                ziyārat
             to the shrine of ʿAbd al-Khāliq. Halting a fourth of a Farsakh from the
            village of Unf al-Bayān, on the way back from the pilgrimage, every person travelling
            from Bukhara to Ghijduvan can see the sacred footprints at the aforementioned mulberry
            tree.</span>
