            <h3 id="premise">The Premise</h3>
            <div>In 1910 (1328 h.) a Central Asian scholar named Muḥammad Ṣādiq Qarāwul Bīgī
                Gulshanī Bukhārī ("Gulshani" for short) wrote a geographical treatise about his
                native country of Bukhara. At that time, Bukhara was a semi-autonomous protectorate
                of the Russian Empire, and its territory is now split between Uzbekistan and
                Tajikistan. Using a combination of XML markup and geo-spatial mapping software, this
                project will use this text to gain a sense of the world of Bukhara from Gulshani's
                vantage point. What locations were imagined to be the most culturally significant?
                How do the locales most important to Gulshani relate to population centers today?
                Can we get a sense of what was "foreign" and distant from Bukhara? </div>
            <h3 id="place">The Place</h3>
            <div>Today Bukhara is a city located in southern Uzbekistan.</div>

            <div>
                <p>But in Gulshani's time, Bukhara was the name of both a major city and a
                    protectorate of the Russian Empire, a status it had held since the conquest of
                    1868.</p>

            <div>
                <p>The city of Bukhara was an ancient cultural center of Central Asia, boasting
                    hundreds of madrasas (Islamic colleges), mosques, and Sufi lodges. Gulshani's
                    account deepens our understanding of the cultural, religious, and economic
                    landscape of the protectorate as a whole.</p>
            </div>
            <h3 id="text" class="clear">The Text</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Gulshani's Persian-langauge text (which has never been translated) details the
                    cultural, economic, and political landscape of Bukhara. The work is titled
                        <em>Tārīkh-i Humāyūn</em> ("The Auspicious History"). The text is 133 folios
                    long; the sole known manuscript (catalog no. 2968) is housed in Institute of
                    Language, Literature, Oriental and Written Heritage of Tajikistan (in Dushanbe).
                    A Tajik (i.e. in Cyrillic script, titled <em>Таърихи Ҳумоюн</em>) edition of
                    this work was published in Dushanbe in 2006 by Jurabek Nazriev in a relatively
                    low print-run (500 copies).</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>This may be the only <em>gazetteer</em>-type geographical text ever written about
                    the Bukharan emirate-cum-protectorate in Persian manuscript form. Geographical
                    works are a known genre in Islamicate writing more generally; there was a boom
                    in Arabic geographical writing in the middle ages (e.g. Yaqut al-Hamawi). And
                    there is no shortage of Russian-language travelogues (and indeed, Gulshani
                    himself incorporated some of that material, referencing <a
                        href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ux4PAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Meiendorf&amp;pg=PP9#v=onepage&amp;q=Meiendorf&amp;f=false"
                        target="_blank">Baron von Meyendorff's 1820 expedition</a>). But the genre
                    virtually unkown in early modern Central Asia, and therefore represents a unique
                    combination of colonial-influenced genre and local knowledge.</p>
                <p>The text begins in the city of Bukhara itself, moves to the suburbs, and then
                    radiates outward into the provinces, ending with the mountainous hinterland now
                    located in Tajikistan. Gulshani's interests are broad, ranging from local
                    cultural lore and religious arcana to economic production and ethnographic
                    makeup. Oftentimes summary statistics are glossed in the margins with red ink.</p>
