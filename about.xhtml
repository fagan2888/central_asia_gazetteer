        <h1>Mapping Gulshani's Gazetteer</h1>
        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <div>In 1910 (1328 h.) a Central Asian scholar named Muḥammad Ṣādiq Qarāwul Bīgī Gulshanī
            Bukhārī ("Gulshani" for short) wrote a geographical treatise about his native country of
            Bukhara. At that time, Bukhara was a semi-autonomous protectorate of the Russian Empire,
            and its territory is now split between Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.</div>
        <section>
            <div id="mapid"></div>
            <script type="text/javascript" src="rsrc/js/bukhara_protectorate_map.js">//</script>
        </section>
        <div>Gulshani's text (which has never been translated) details the cultural, economic, and
            political landscape of Bukhara. Using a combination of XML markup and geo-spatial
            mapping software (QGIS), this project will use this text to gain a sense of the world of
            Bukhara from Gulshani's vantage point. What locations were imagined to be the most
            culturally significant? How do the locales most important to Gulshani relate to
            population centers today? Can we get a sense of what was "foreign" and distant from
            Bukhara? </div>
