   <h3>geography</h3>
   <span>The second 
                province
                wilāyat ū ḥukūmat
             of the provinces of Bukhara is the 
                district
                qaẓā
             of Qarakol. Its distance from Bukhara the Noble is seven 
                farsakhs
                A "farsakh" is an old Persian unit of measurement, around 4
                    miles.
            .</span>
   <h3>lore</h3>
   <span>This province is vast and populous. The denizens of this province are all well-off, and
            all of them 
                have livestock
                have herds
            . In the past, this province was even vaster; [but then] in the span of a
            century, sand enveloped a quarter of the province from the west, north, and south.
            Nevertheless, [Qarakol is among] the most propserous of the provinces. Due to a 
                lack of learning
                ʿadam-i ʿilm
            , the population does not engage in trade. However, in this province there are
            many individuals who own more than one or two million 
                Tanga
                a currency
            , and many of them are even wealthier than the Bukharan merchants. Qarakol
            [sheep] skins are well known for their high value, and are even more prized in 
                Europe
                Ūrūpā ū Farangistān
             than in Bukhara, and are obtainable in greater numbers and earlier [in the
            season] than in other provinces.</span>
   <h3>economic</h3>
   <span>In this province there is: one 
                brick and mortar
                sangīn
             madrasa and one 
                qārī-khāna
                Qur'an recitation center
            ; adjacent to the 
                fortress
                Qurghan
             are seven 
                sufi lodges
                khānaqāh
             (both wooden and stone) and eighteen mosques. [The province] comprises 809
            villages, which contain 150,000 residents. </span>
   <h3>infrastructure</h3>
   <span>Water in this province is inadequate, but despite that, agriculture is good. In a bad
            [drought] year, the land is irrigated, which leads to a strong harvest.</span>
   <h3>agricultural</h3>
   <span>To the west of this province is a 
                salt mine
                maʿdan-i namak
            , located four farsakhs 
                from the center
                az markaz-i qażā-yi ān
            . Every year around ten thousand individuals beset by 
                illnesses of the nerves
                amrāż-i ʿaṣabānī
            , such as 
                back pain
                ʿirq al-nisā
            , come to this salt mine for treatment. Even foreigners consider the mineral
            water from this mine to be superior to others.</span>
   <h3>nat-resources</h3>
   <span>To the east of this province, in the territory of 
                Paykand
                Paykand was indeed a major silk road town destroyed during the
                    Arab conquests.
            , there is a ruin in the sand. This is in fact the original, ancient city of
            Bukhara, and 
                Ubaydallah ibn Ziyad
                The text actually identifies this Arab general as ʿAbdallāh
                    ibn Ziyād, but the author surely intended ʿUbaydallāh ibn Ziyād (d. 686), who
                    led the first Arab invasion of Bukhara.
             fought there. Now all of the 
                walls and fortresses
                suwar ū qalʿa ū arg
             and some of the buildings still remain, but - in the words of the holy Qur'an
            - 
                "and it was an empty and ruined town"
                The longer passge is: "Or such as he who passed by a city that
                    was fallen down upon its turrets; he said, 'How shall God give life to this now
                    it is dead?'" (Q 2:259)
            . The people of Paykand excavate this area to find silver and gold coins, and
            other old artifacts, and in this manner make their living. The reason for the ruination
            of this province is twofold: first, the Arab armies devastated it during the conquest
            [of the 7th and 8th centuries]; second, sand has enveloped it. For these two reasons,
            the province has fallen into ruin.</span>
