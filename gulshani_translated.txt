Qarakol

The second province (wilāyat ū ḥukūmat) of the provinces of Bukhara is the district (qaẓā) of Qarakol. Its distance from Bukhara the Noble is seven farsakhs. This province is vast and populous. The denizens of this province are all well-off, and all of them have livestock [lit. "have herds"]. In the past, this province was even vaster; [but then] in the span of a century, sand enveloped a quarter of the province from the west, north, and south. Nevertheless, [Qarakol is among] the most propserous of the provinces. Due to a lack of learning (ʿadam-i ʿilm), the population does not engage in trade. However, in this province there are many individuals who own more than one or two million Tanga [a currency], and many of them are even wealthier than the Bukharan merchants. Qarakol [sheep] skins are well known for their high value, and are even more prized in Europe (Ūrūpā ū Farangistān) than in Bukhara.
