# Textually Mapping Central Asia

In 1910 (1328 h.) a Central Asian scholar named Muḥammad Ṣādiq Qarāwul Bīgī Gulshanī Bukhārī ("Gulshani" for short) wrote a geographical treatise about his native country of Bukhara. At that time, Bukhara was a semi-autonomous protectorate of the Russian Empire, and its territory is now split between Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Gulshani's text (which has never been translated) details the cultural, economic, and political landscape of Bukhara.

Using a combination of XML markup and geo-spatial mapping software (QGIS), this project will use this text to gain a sense of the world of Bukhara from Gulshani's vantage point. What locations were imagined to be the most culturally significant? How do the locales most important to Gulshani relate to population centers today? Can we get a sense of what was "foreign" and distant from Bukhara?
