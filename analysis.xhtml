            <h2>Preliminary Analysis</h2>
            <h3>Research Questions</h3>
            <div>
                <p>This project partly aims to produce a digital edition and translation of an
                    otherwise little-known text. But there are research questions underpinning the
                    production of that resource, and which underscore the value of this source.</p>
                <p>What <em>was</em> the protectorate of Bukhara? Typical maps of the region during
                    this period posit nice, clean boundaries of the polity:</p>
                <img class="turk_map" src="rsrc/images/standard_turkestan_map.png"
                    alt="Map of Southern Turkestan" />
                <p>But what were the contours of that territory? Not all of the territory shaded
                    yellow in maps such as the above were equally integrated into the protectorate.
                    Infrastructure development varied, as did the sacred geogrpahy. Even seemingly
                    basic questions like relative population levels is not something we have a clear
                    picture of during this period. And although we are still just barely scratching
                    the surface, having only edited and translated three province sections of
                    Gulshani's text, in principle the source sheds light on all of these
                    questions.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Population Levels</h3>
            <div>
                <p>For instance, the cirles in this map are sized proportionate to the total
                    population of the province, according to Gulshani. (Again, only the provinces we
                    have covered so far).</p>

                    alt="Population According to Gulshani" />
            </div>
            <h3>Religious Infrastructure I: Mosques</h3>
            <div>
                <p>This map offers a sense of the density of mosques by province:</p>
                <img class="turk_map" src="rsrc/images/gul_mosques.png" alt="Mosque Density" />
            </div>
            <h3>Religious Infrastructure II: Sufi Lodges</h3>
            <div>
                <p>And this one offers a sense of the how integrated different provinces were into
                    Sufi networks by representing the number of lodges in the area:</p>
